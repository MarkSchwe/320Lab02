# 320Lab02

program made in WSL, which uses the selection sort method created in lab 1 in order to test the average success rate of a binary search within an array of 10000 random numbers inclusively between 0 and 99999. In performing this task, the program works very well. Making it was very toublesome, however, due to issues that I had overlooked in the selection sort method I had created, which was poorly optimized and ended up wasting a lot of time, to the extent that I had to completely scrap the method and create a new one from scratch. creating the new one took around 15 minutes.
